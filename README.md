# Agricultural-Yield-Prediction-and-Optimization
This project aims to predict crop yields and optimize agricultural inputs to support sustainable farming. Using a dataset with features like farm area, fertilizer and pesticide usage, crop type, irrigation, soil type, and water consumption, it builds models to estimate yields.
